			<li><h2>Intro</h2><h3>A first-time blogger blogs about learning how to 
				program, and hopefully learns how to blog in the process</h3>
				<p>Here I am at ground zero of my decision to take up web development 
				as a potential career. On February 29, 2016, I will begin a nineteen 
				week program designed to turn me into a full stack Java developer. 
				These "developer boot camps," as they're called, are really in these days.
				It seems universities can't churn out qualified CS degree holders fast
				enough to meet the industry's demand, and programs are popping up all 
				over hoping to fill in the training gap and take their slice of the 
				tech-$ cake. I chose 
				<a href = "http://www.skilldistillery.com">Skill Distillery</a> 
				for 3 reasons: 1. Skill Distillery 
				is the only program of its kind (at the time of this writing) to accept
				the GI Bill. As a veteran of the US Navy with a GI Bill burning a hole in 
				my pocket right now, this is a huge selling point. 2. Curriculum. Skill 
				Distillery's main priority is to help me get a job. Where a lot of other
				boot camps focus on Ruby, Java is a key component on most developer job
				announcements. I learned Java almost 20 years ago, and apparently it's 
				still a thing. 3. Geographical location. Skill Distillery happens to be
				right down the road from my home town of Littleton, Colorado. 
				Besides, who can argue with the 
				Rocky Mountains? No one can. Mountains are made of rocks, and rocks
				don't argue.</p><p>So join me on my journey as I attempt to get from
				neophyte to knowledgeable in nineteen weeks. 
				Witness my frustrations, excitement, 
				victories, and failures. What could be more fun?

				<h3>Pre-work! And,</h3>
			    <h3>The difference between <sp>switch</sp> and 
			    <sp>if else</sp> in Java</h3>
			    <p>I'm in the midst of pre-work for the developer boot camp I'm starting 
			    in 24 days. I've been tasked with building a web presence via this blog. 
			    This is meant to showcase my growing technical knowledge, though I will 
			    also be using it to vent my frustrations, gloat over my breakthroughs 
			    (assuming these will occur), 
			    and muse over the process of learning in general.</p>
			    <p>I'm currently working through <a href="http://learnjavathehardway.org">
			    Learn Java The Hard Way</a>. This seems like a great text for beginners. 
			    Lots of practice writing workable code, lots of repetition. As I am not 
			    a complete beginner, there's a bit too much repetition and slow build-up
			    for my taste. So I do skip around a bit, and hope that's not just a 
			    manifestation of my lack of patience. As for technical details, I suppose 
			    it's time to throw you a tidbit...</p>
			    <p><sp class="emph">if else statements in Java. What are they all about?
			    </sp>
			    <br>The basic construct goes like this:
			    <br><br><sp class="code">if (condition is true) {do this}</sp>
			    <br><br>else can be used in conjunction, as an "otherwise..." statement:
			    <br><br><sp class="code">if (condition is true) {do this}
			    <br>else {do that}</sp>
			    <br><br>multiple mutually exclusive conditions can be tested in a 
			    chain of if else statements:
			    <br><br><sp class="code">if (condition A is true) {do this}
			    <br>else if (condition B is true) {do this other thing}
			    <br>else if (condition C is true) {do that}
			    <br>else {do something else entirely}</sp>
			    </p>
			    <p>So if else is an all-purpose construct for testing conditions. Another 
			    way to test for conditions is the switch statement. Switch has a narrower 
			    range of applicability, but in certain circumstances is the best option. 
			    Consider the following pseudo-example:
			    <br><br><sp class="code">switch(variable with, say, 4 possible values) {
			    <br>case 1: do a thing; break;
			    <br>case 2: do another thing; break;
			    <br>case 3: do a third thing; break;
			    <br>case 4: do a fourth thing; break;
			    <br>}</sp>
			    <p><sp class="emph">switch: when do I use it?</sp> 
			    There are a couple things to consider.
			    Any switch statement could be written as an if-else statement,
			    but only certain if-else statements can be re-written using switch. Also, 
			    if-else can test over a range of values or conditions (is n less than 5?),
			    but switch tests for equality only and is used when the variable in 
			    question can take one of several (discrete) values. 
			    The example I have seen most often
			    is months of the year. The variable "month" can only take one of 12 values.
			    In this scenario using switch works better than if-else for two reasons. 
			    First, it's faster. switch is compiled to a lookup table and involves one 
			    operation. Written as an if-else statement, each case is tested, which
			    takes N operations (N being the number of cases). 
			    Second, it's cleaner and easier to read and maintain.

				<h3>Java the Hard Way next steps, and working with arrays</h3>
				<p>Over the past week I have skipped around through the Java the Hard
				Way book, going through exercises I found interesting. At the very end
				of the book, Graham Mitchell gives us a nice pat on the back for 
				finishing these 58 exercises, then tells us we still need a lot more
				practice. And it's true! He gives a link to a series of assignments he 
				gives to his students: </p>
				<p><a href = "https://programmingbydoing.com/">
				programmingbydoing.com</a></p><p>
				I like these exercises because I don't get to cheat by looking at the 
				code already written in front of me and typing it out word for word.
				That puts me in a trance-like state and I have a hard time really learning
				the material. These "next step" exercises force me to rely on my memory 
				and work through a little trial and error before I figure things out.</p>
				<p>So for example, in the middle of the section on arrays, Mitchell 
				challenges us to create an array of 10 random numbers between 1 and 50.
				Then we ask the user for a number between 1 and 50 and tell them whether
				or that number is in the array. Here is the code I came up with: <br><br>
				<sp class = "code">
import java.util.Scanner;<br><br>

public class FindaValue {<br>
	public static void main(String[] args) {<br>
		int[] arr = new int[10];<br>
		int i = 0;<br>
		for(i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {<br>
		   arr[i] = (int)(50*Math.random() + 1);<br>
		}<br><br>
		
		Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);<br>
		System.out.print("What number between 1 and 50 are you looking for? ");<br>
		int guess = keyboard.nextInt();<br><br>
		
		for(i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {<br>
		   if(guess == arr[i]) System.out.println(guess + " is in the array!");<br>
		}<br>
	}<br>
}
				</sp><br><br>
				If the style of this code is lacking in indentation, it's because 
				I'm still a very new beginner with html and css, and haven't yet 
				figured out the best way to insert whitespace. Just use your 
				imagination for now.</p>
				<p>
				Java is a little awkward in my opinion. One of the more awkward things 
				I do in Java is initializing an array. "int[] arr = new int[10]" seems
				like it has a couple redundancies, but that's Java. There are three 
				steps in initializing an array. First you declare it (int[] arr), 
				and in this case I'm creating an integer array. This is important. 
				You can't just throw a double into an integer array and hope that the
				array will convert to an int for you. Your types have 
				to match. The second step is to 
				allocate space for the items you want to hold (new int[10]).
				This second step is also important. In Java, you can't 
				change the size of your
				array. If you say you want 10 integers, you will never be able to add 
				an 11th integer to that array. You would have to create a larger array 
				and copy everything from the old to the new array. Anyway, the third 
				step is to initialize the values held in the array. There is more 
				than one way to do this, but in the code here, I use a for loop with 
				a random number generator.</p>
				<p>Notice in the for loop where I use i < arr.length as my condition, 
				even though I know there are 10 items in the array, and 10 is a lot 
				shorter to write than arr.length. I do it this way because it's more 
				robust. Say I want to use this code again, but make the array bigger. 
				I won't have to scan through the code to see if I need to change a 
				bunch of 10s to, say, 50s. No matter what the size of the array happens 
				to be, the loop will go through the whole thing.</p>
				<p>Hope everyone has a great weekend. Happy Birthday, Lincoln!</p>
