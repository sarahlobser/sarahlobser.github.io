			<li><h2>Intro</h2><h3>A first-time blogger blogs about learning how to 
				program, and hopefully learns how to blog in the process</h3>
				<p>Here I am at ground zero of my decision to take up web development 
				as a potential career. On February 29, 2016, I will begin a nineteen 
				week program designed to turn me into a full stack Java developer. 
				These "developer boot camps," as they're called, are really in these days.
				It seems universities can't churn out qualified CS degree holders fast
				enough to meet the industry's demand, and programs are popping up all 
				over hoping to fill in the training gap and take their slice of the 
				tech-$ cake. I chose 
				<a href = "http://www.skilldistillery.com">Skill Distillery</a> 
				for 3 reasons: 1. Skill Distillery 
				is the only program of its kind (at the time of this writing) to accept
				the GI Bill. As a veteran of the US Navy with a GI Bill burning a hole in 
				my pocket right now, this is a huge selling point. 2. Curriculum. Skill 
				Distillery's main priority is to help me get a job. Where a lot of other
				boot camps focus on Ruby, Java is a key component on most developer job
				announcements. I learned Java almost 20 years ago, and apparently it's 
				still a thing. 3. Geographical location. Skill Distillery happens to be
				right down the road from my home town of Littleton, Colorado. 
				Besides, who can argue with the 
				Rocky Mountains? No one can. Mountains are made of rocks, and rocks
				don't argue.</p><p>So join me on my journey as I attempt to get from
				neophyte to knowledgeable in nineteen weeks. 
				Witness my frustrations, excitement, 
				victories, and failures. What could be more fun?

				<h3>Pre-work! And,</h3>
			    <h3>The difference between <sp>switch</sp> and 
			    <sp>if else</sp> in Java</h3>
			    <p>I'm in the midst of pre-work for the developer boot camp I'm starting 
			    in 24 days. I've been tasked with building a web presence via this blog. 
			    This is meant to showcase my growing technical knowledge, though I will 
			    also be using it to vent my frustrations, gloat over my breakthroughs 
			    (assuming these will occur), 
			    and muse over the process of learning in general.</p>
			    <p>I'm currently working through <a href="http://learnjavathehardway.org">
			    Learn Java The Hard Way</a>. This seems like a great text for beginners. 
			    Lots of practice writing workable code, lots of repetition. As I am not 
			    a complete beginner, there's a bit too much repetition and slow build-up
			    for my taste. So I do skip around a bit, and hope that's not just a 
			    manifestation of my lack of patience. As for technical details, I suppose 
			    it's time to throw you a tidbit...</p>
			    <p><sp class="emph">if else statements in Java. What are they all about?
			    </sp>
			    <br>The basic construct goes like this:
			    <br><br><sp class="code">if (condition is true) {do this}</sp>
			    <br><br>else can be used in conjunction, as an "otherwise..." statement:
			    <br><br><sp class="code">if (condition is true) {do this}
			    <br>else {do that}</sp>
			    <br><br>multiple mutually exclusive conditions can be tested in a 
			    chain of if else statements:
			    <br><br><sp class="code">if (condition A is true) {do this}
			    <br>else if (condition B is true) {do this other thing}
			    <br>else if (condition C is true) {do that}
			    <br>else {do something else entirely}</sp>
			    </p>
			    <p>So if else is an all-purpose construct for testing conditions. Another 
			    way to test for conditions is the switch statement. Switch has a narrower 
			    range of applicability, but in certain circumstances is the best option. 
			    Consider the following pseudo-example:
			    <br><br><sp class="code">switch(variable with, say, 4 possible values) {
			    <br>case 1: do a thing; break;
			    <br>case 2: do another thing; break;
			    <br>case 3: do a third thing; break;
			    <br>case 4: do a fourth thing; break;
			    <br>}</sp>
			    <p><sp class="emph">switch: when do I use it?</sp> 
			    There are a couple things to consider.
			    Any switch statement could be written as an if-else statement,
			    but only certain if-else statements can be re-written using switch. Also, 
			    if-else can test over a range of values or conditions (is n less than 5?),
			    but switch tests for equality only and is used when the variable in 
			    question can take one of several (discrete) values. 
			    The example I have seen most often
			    is months of the year. The variable "month" can only take one of 12 values.
			    In this scenario using switch works better than if-else for two reasons. 
			    First, it's faster. switch is compiled to a lookup table and involves one 
			    operation. Written as an if-else statement, each case is tested, which
			    takes N operations (N being the number of cases). 
			    Second, it's cleaner and easier to read and maintain.
