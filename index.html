	<p id="fronttext">Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to dedicate this web page 
	to my own learning of web development. I suppose I'll have a section   
	<sp id="about">about</sp> myself, like where I'm from and what I've done in the 
	past and such. Then I'll make another section just for my
	<a id="blog" href="http://sarahlobser.github.io/blog.html">blog</a>, and in this 
	section I'll blog
	about all the experiences I have while I'm learning about 
	programming and such. At first there will be a lot about Java, but I suppose I'd like 
	to also include my general experiences of learning this stuff. Then of course I'll 
	have an entire section devoted to my 
	<sp id="projects">projects</sp>, assuming I will have some projects I'd like to 
	share with the world at some point. I'm guessing this link will open to an 
	empty page for a while until I have something to add. Well this is going to be fun!</p>
